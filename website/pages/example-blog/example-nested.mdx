# Example Nested Page

This is a nested page example, demonstrating how to use React components in MDX files that are in nested directories.

## Nested Routes

The file path of this MDX file is:

```
website/pages/example-dir/example-nested.mdx
```

Which becomes the route:

```
/example-dir/example-nested
```

<Accordion
  items={[
    {
      title: "What is MDX?",
      content:
        "MDX is a format that lets you write JSX in your markdown documents.",
    },
    {
      title: "Why use React Router?",
      content:
        "React Router enables navigation between views in a React application, allowing for a single-page application experience.",
    },
    {
      title: "How to use components in MDX?",
      content:
        "Import them at the top of your MDX file and then use them as JSX tags in your content.",
    },
  ]}
/>

You can navigate back to other pages using the navigation bar above.
