# Welcome to the MDX Static Site Generator

This is the homepage of our MDX + React static site generator. It demonstrates how to use MDX with React components.

## Interactive Components

Below is an example of using the Counter component:

<Counter initialCount={5} />

And here's an example of using the Button component:

<Button variant="primary" size="lg">
  Click Me
</Button>

## How It Works

This site is built using:

- Vite
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- MDX

Each `.mdx` file in the `website/pages` directory becomes a route in the final built site.

## Adding New Pages

To add a new page, simply create a new `.mdx` file in the `website/pages` directory. The file path determines the route.

For example:

- `website/pages/about.mdx` becomes `/about/`
- `website/pages/blog/post-1.mdx` becomes `/blog/post-1/`

</PageWrapper>
