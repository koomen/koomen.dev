# AI Horseless Carriages

I noticed something interesting the other day: I enjoy building with AI a lot more than I enjoy using most of the software that other people have built with AI. 

When I build with AI I feel like I can accomplish almost anything I can imagine very quickly. AI feels like a power tool. It's a lot of fun.

Most AI apps don't feel like that, though. They rarely do things the way that I want them done, and fixing that is often more work than just doing the thing myself. Using AI apps feels like a chore, like managing an underperforming employee.

This has been bugging me for a while and a few days ago I finally realized why. I am beginning to suspect that most of today's AI apps are horseless carriages.

In this essay I'm going to explain what I mean by that, and then do my best to make predictions about what apps that take full advantage of AI will look like. It is broken into three parts.

1. **Bad AI apps.** Here I'll describe the experience of using a bad AI app. I'm sure it will be familiar to most of you by now. 
2. **Riding in Horseless Carriages.** Here I'll explain why I think this particular flavor of bad AI app is the horseless carriage of our era. Then I'll ask and answer the question: what does a good AI app look like?
3. **Good AI apps.** Here I'll describe what I think good AI apps will look like.
