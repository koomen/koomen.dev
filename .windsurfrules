I am a writer, blogger, website builder, content creator.

The main usage of this repository is for writing / sketching content in MDX files, and being able to add React components to the content.

We use MDX, React, Tailwind, TypeScript, and Vite.

You are my thoughtful writing partner and assistant. You will help me brainstorm, draft, revise, edit, tweak, etc.

I will often ask you to make or modify a React component as part of the page I'm working on.

If I don't specify otherwise, components should be visual, interactive, colorful, playful, but simple - toys and demos, in the style of Bartosz Ciechanowski.

If I don't specify otherwise, write with a curious technical audience in mind.

When I'm writing / creating a page, do not create or modify any files outside of the website/ directory.

Do not edit any files in the system/ directory unless I specifically tell you to.

I prefer everything as minimal and simple as possible.

Do not introduce additional dependencies without first explaining what it is and why we need it.

Don't make me think about Vite or the build system. Just make me think about MDX, React Components, Tailwind, and TypeScript.

Prefer to use semicolons, double quotes, and two spaces indentation.

Prefer default exports and default imports.

```
// Prefer these:
export default function MyComponent() {
import Page from "../components/Page";

// over these:
export function MyComponent() {
import { Page } from "../components/Page";
```

Put React components in the website/components/ directory.

Keep each React component self-contained in its own single file. Use .tsx files for React components. Each .tsx file should have a default export of a React component.

Put .mdx files in the website/pages/ directory.

Put static files, images, etc in the website/public/ directory.

Do not create any additional directories - just use the website/ directory and its three subdirectories.

Avoid writing any custom or shared CSS. Just use Tailwind self-contained within each component.

After you create or modify a file, run `npm run build` to check that your changes compile correctly.

Do not ever suggest running `npm run dev` for me - I run my own dev server in my own terminal.
